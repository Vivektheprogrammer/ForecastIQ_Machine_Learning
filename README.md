# 4.-ForecastIQ-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Temperature-and-Rainfall-Prediction
Comparative analysis of machine learning models for environmental prediction. This project demonstrates the superior performance of ensemble methods (Extra Trees, XGBoost, LightGBM) over SVM in forecasting rainfall amount, rainfall occurrence, and temperature, highlighting the value of integrating air quality data.
